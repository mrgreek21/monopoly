Part 1 -- Introduction to the game:

This is a standard monopoly chess game board.

We have:
	- the main board divided into several blocks.
	- small houses into different colors.
	- condos representing the big companies.
	- the “Question” (?) for the chance card drawing
	- the jewellery chest
	- a “GO” sign for the starting block.
	- the jail

There are two chess characters:
	- Mario
	- Pikachu
