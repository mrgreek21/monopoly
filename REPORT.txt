Part 1 -- Introduction to the game:

This is a standard monopoly chess game board.

We have:
	- the main board divided into several blocks.
	- small houses into different colors.
	- condos representing the big companies.
	- the “Question” (?) for the chance card drawing
	- the jewellery chest
	- a “GO” sign for the starting block.
	- the jail

There are two chess characters:
	- Mario
	- Pikachu

The users can let the dice roll to a random number,
then the charaters will move automatically.

(We cannot implement all the feature of the real game
due to the time limit.)

Part 2 -- Where we come up the idea.

When we solving the assignment 2 (individually),
we found some trick way to draw the 3D graph in open GL,
which can make fancy characters in a fast way
(like the Pikachu only cost us five to ten minute to draw).

This tech (or trick) result in our decision to build a well
designed 3D world in our final project.

The idea of actually making the monopoly game is by 
one of our group members girlfriend.

Yu’s strength is model building while Andreas is a genius of 
frame works and files planing.

We believe this project will let we both contribute
equally and end up with a good representation of the monopoly
game.
